<br>
There are lots of terms or algorithms we have not covered yet in this class so far. And this example is just a script of python code. It is also not a complete project. For example, besides the python code, you also need to write a report and to deploy your project in somewhere. Finally, you need to preprare a slides to demo your project in the last meeting of this class. <b> I will update this page frequently next few weeks. Please check this page for new information later</b>
<br>
</p>

<p>
<b> Outline of a complete project</b><br>

1. Proposal a task.<br>
2. Collect data.<br>
3. Clean, analyze, and preprocess data.<br>
4. Formulate the task into a data mining problem. Identify this problem as one type of tasks we have learned in class. <br>
5. Choose multipe algorithms to mine the data.<br>
6. Evaluate the perfomances of these algorithms and choose a best one. <br>
7. Explain and visualize results. <br>

<b> Project Steps and Due time</b><br>
<br>
Step 1, due 11/15, Wednesday<br>
Tasks: 1) collect data. 2) clean data(noise, outlier, n/a value). 3) apply one algorithm to run the data
explain the results. <br>
Submit: 1) code. 2) support file to explain each step and the results. 3) team file to explain each member's work. 4) pandas.ipynb and sklearn.ipynb<br>
<br>
Step 2, due 11/27, Monday<br>
Tasks: 1) choose at least five different algorithms to run the data. 2) use grid search and cross-validation to choose the best
parameters and model. 3) use k-fold, ROC, or other methods to evaluate these models.
4) draw at least FOUR visualized graphs of the results, using Matplotlib, seaborn, Bokeh, and plotly.
For example, distribution of features, boxplot of features, importances of features, explanation of models, data fitting,
model evaluation, prediction results, etc<br>
Submit: 1) code. 2) support file. 3) team file. 4) github link <br>
<br>

Step 3, due 12/6, Wednesday
Tasks: 1) Generate your own data for prediction. <br>
2) Explain your the visualization results with at least 100 words for each plot. <br>
Copy and these plots and explanations in a word file. <a href="./Explain Plots.docx">Example</a>. <br>
3) Answer each of these questions using at least 100 words.<br>
1. Please describe the data of your mode. For example, categorical or continuous data, distribution of data, source of data, dimension of data, size of data, etc.<br>
2. How do you preprocess the data? Noise? Missing value？ Outlier？<br>
3. Which five models did you choose to build the modle? Why do you choose these five models based on your data?<br>
4. Which one is best? Can you exlain why this model performs best on your data?<br>
5. Is it possible that your model is underfit or overfit? Why?<br>
6. What features are most importances of your data? Why? Can you explain it based on the context of the data?<br>
7. What is the most difficult part in the first two steps of this project? Why?<br>
8. Is there any plots, parameters, or data that you cannot explain it?<br>
9. What aspects of your model that you could improve? Why?<br>
10. Why do you think your model work on your data?
<br><br>

Goal: <br>
1. Explainable <br>
2. Public and private testing Data <br>

<br><br>
Submit: 1) code. 2) support file. 3) team file. 4) github link 5) draft of slides<br>

<br>
Step 4, due 12/13, Wednesday<br>
Submit: 1) writing report. 2) final slides. 3) all source code.
