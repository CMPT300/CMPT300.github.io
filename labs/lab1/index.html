            1. Select a partner on your own <a target="_blank"

              up</a>. The rules are you must pair with a new partner
            each week.<br>
            <br>
            2. Work as a pair to complete the lab. At the end of the lab
            period, make sure to share all files with each partner.<br>
            <br>
            3. Each partner will submit the lab separately. (Submission
            instructions are described later in this lab.) <br>
            <br>
            4. If you do not finish the lab during the lab period, you
            may either get together outside of class to complete it, or
            complete it on your own. If you choose to complete it on
            your own, be sure to indicate this in your submission. <br>

    <b>Objectives</b><br>
    <br>
    - Understand the basics of Python programming<br>
    <br>
    - Run and develop Python in Jupyter Notebook<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font face="Garamond"> Before proceeding with this lab, be sure you
      have downloaded and installed all necessary software</a> on your personal
      laptop.<br>
      <br>
      <b> Introduction to Python</b><br>
      <br>
      Use git to download the following python files:<br>
      <br>
      Open git shell (windows) or terminal (Mac). <br>
      cd to a folder which you want to save the materials of this course. <br>
      git clone https://github.com/CMPT300/CMPT300.git<br>
      <br>
      Now you could see one .ipynb files under CMPT300/labs/lab1.<br><br>
      Use jupyter notebook to open this file.<br>
      <br>
      Mac: Click the app to launch jupyter notebook, and then go to the folder you need. <br>
      Windows: (1) Lauch jupyter notebook if the folder you need is under "C:\Users\username". Otherwise, <br>
       (2) Click the "start" and input "cmd" to lauch the terminal. cd to the folder you need and input command "jupyter notebook". <br>
       Example:<br>
       C:\User\username> D: <br>
       D:\> cd CMPT300 <br>
       D:\CMPT300> jupyter notebook<br>

      <br>
      As a class, we will use these files to demonstrate how to design
      unit tests and run Python programs.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What to Submit</span><br>
      <br>
      Be sure to include your names at the top of each source file.
      Refer to program grading guidelines</a> for best practices for submitting source code.<br>
      <br>
      Please submit your <font face="Courier New"><big>intro.ipynb</big></font>
     to Canvas. Be sure to include the names of each
      partner on the submission. (<b>Each partner needs to submit the
        files</b>.)<br>
